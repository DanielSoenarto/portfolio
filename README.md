## Profile

I am bioinformatics graduate with plenty of international working experience, a good understanding of genomics and molecular biology, proficient in programming, and interested in artificial intelligence applications.

During my undergraduate studies, I have been involved in research on integrating multi-omics data using biostatistics and neural network approaches, developing pipelines and visualization tool for genomics surveillance, and learning to fine-tune neural networksâ€™ hyperparameters for phylogenetics inference. These experiences led me to discover my passion for using bioinformatics and artificial intelligence (AI) to analyze biological data for advancing precision medicine and improving healthcare.
